    NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on Polygon are unique digital assets that are stored on the Polygon
    blockchain network. NFTs represent ownership of a specific asset or collectible, such as digital
    art, music, videos, and other digital content. Polygon provides a low-cost and fast way to mint,
    transfer, and trade NFTs, making it an ideal platform for creators and collectors to exchange
    and showcase their digital assets. The growing popularity of NFTs has led to an explosion of
    innovative use cases, such as NFT gaming, virtual real estate, and even social media profiles.
    Overall, NFTs on Polygon offer an exciting new way to own, trade, and experience unique digital
    assets.
